# Software-Engineering-Principles-Explained
This assignment focuses on the transition from just "writing code" to the professional discipline of engineering software. Here is a comprehensive response to the tasks outlined in your document.

# Programming and Software Construction
Both are used interchangeably but they have a significant difference between them that is to say;

Programming involves writing code to solve a specific problems or implement an algorithm. 
**WHILE**

Software construction is the process of building software products. It includes programming and other steps like testing, design, maintainability, implementation, debbugging, deployment and requirement gathering.

**Real life scenario**





## 2. How Poor Maintainability Can Cause Serious Problems

Poor maintainability happens when software is difficult to understand, modify, or fix. This often occurs due to messy code, lack of comments, or poor structure.

**Example scenario:**  
A hospital uses a patient management system that was poorly maintained. The original developers did not document the code, and variable names are confusing. When new developers try to update the system to add emergency features, they accidentally introduce bugs that affect patient records.

This can lead to:
1.Data loss or incorrect patient information
2. System downtime
3. Delays in medical services
4.Increased costs and risks to human life

This shows why maintainable software is critical, especially in systems that affect real people.
