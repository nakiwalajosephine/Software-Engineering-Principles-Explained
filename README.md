# Software-Engineering-Principles-Explained(BY GROUP 8)
This assignment focuses on the transition from just "writing code" to the professional discipline of engineering software. Here is a comprehensive response to the tasks outlined in your document.

# 1. Programming and Software Construction
Both are used interchangeably but they have a significant difference between them that is to say;

Programming involves writing code to solve a specific problems or implement an algorithm. 
**WHILE**

Software construction is the process of building software products. It includes programming and other steps like testing, design, maintainability, implementation, debbugging, deployment and requirement gathering.

**Real life scenario:** Building a Professional Kitchen

If you were building a restaurant kitchen, the distinction would look like this:

1. Programming (The "Craft")

Programming is like the Chef’s knife skills. It is the specific technical task of dicing an onion or searing a steak perfectly. It requires precision, knowledge of the tool, and a specific technique to get the desired result (a solved problem). If a chef has poor knife skills, the dish fails. Similarly, if a programmer can't write clean logical code, the function of the code fails.

2. Software Construction (The Engineering)

Software Construction is the design and installation of the entire kitchen's infrastructure. It isn't just about cooking the food, it is about ensuring the kitchen actually works as a unit. This includes:

Detailed Design: Planning where the gas lines go so the stoves don't overheat the refrigerators.

Integration: Making sure the industrial dishwasher fits the plumbing and doesn't flood the prep area.

Verification (Testing): Running the vents to ensure smoke is cleared before the first customer arrives.

Coding/Programming: This is still there because it’s the actual cooking of the meals hence it's just one part of the larger construction.


## 2. How Poor Maintainability Can Cause Serious Problems

Poor maintainability happens when software is difficult to understand, modify, or fix. This often occurs due to messy code, lack of comments, or poor structure.

**Example scenario:**  
A hospital uses a patient management system that was poorly maintained. The original developers did not document the code, and variable names are confusing. When new developers try to update the system to add emergency features, they accidentally introduce bugs that affect patient records.

This can lead to:Data loss or incorrect patient information, System downtime, Delays in medical services, Increased costs and risks to human life.

This shows why maintainable software is critical, especially in systems that affect real people.

## 3.The Criticality of Version
In a team environment, Version Control(like Git) aycts as the single source of truth.It is critical for three reasons:

**Collaboration:** Multiple developers can work on the same file simultaneously without overwriting each other's work through "branching" and "merging."

**Accountability and History:** It provides a "time machine." If a bug is introduced on Tuesday, the team can see exactly which line was changed, by whom, and why.

**Risk Mitigation:** If a new feature causes a system failure, the team can "roll back" the entire codebase to a previous stable version in seconds.



## 4. How code Reviews Improve Software Quality And Developer Skills

Code reviews involve developers checking each other's code before it is emerged into the main project.

They improve software quality by : detecting bugs, ensuring coding standards are followed, improving readability and improve structure, reducing security vulnerabilities.

They also help developers grow because: Team members learn better approach from each other, feedback improves problem solving skills, junior developers gain confidence and experience.

Overall, code reviews promote
**shared responsibility and continuous learning**

## 5.Reflection:AI as a Tool for Understanding
AI (like Large Language Models) can be an incredible "tutor" for code comprehension. Instead of asking AI to "write this function for me," a student can use it to explain a complex block of code or summarize what a specific library does. To ensure AI doesn't replace learning.

**Students should:**

Use it to explain why a certain pattern is used.

Ask for "hints" rather than full solutions.

Verify the AI’s output treating the AI as a peer who might be wrong, which forces the student to critically analyze the code themselves.

**Key Takeaway:** Software construction is about building for the future. It’s not just about the code you write today, but how easily that code can be understood and changed by someone else tomorrow.
