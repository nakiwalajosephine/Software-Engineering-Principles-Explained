# Software-Engineering-Principles-Explained
This assignment focuses on the transition from just "writing code" to the professional discipline of engineering software. Here is a comprehensive response to the tasks outlined in your document.

# Programming and Software Construction
Both are used interchangeably but they have a significant difference between them that is to say;

Programming involves writing code to solve a specific problems or implement an algorithm. 
**WHILE**

Software construction is the process of building software products. It includes programming and other steps like testing, design, maintainability, 

# Impact of Code Reviews
Code reviews are a "two-for-one" win for software teams:

**Software Quality:**
They act as a safety net. A second pair of eyes is most likely to spot logical errors,security vulnerabilities,or edge cases that the original autor missed.This ensures high-quality code enters the main product.

**Developer Skills:**
It is a mentorship tool.Junior developers learn bestpractices from senior reviewers,and senior developers stay sharp by explaining their reasoning.I  t spreadsw knowledge so that no single person is theony one who understands a specific part of the system.
